thinkfan (0.9.3-2) unstable; urgency=medium

    On systems using SysV init, thinkfan is now enabled and disabled
    using     update-rc.d and not via the obsolete START=(yes|no) flag
    in /etc/default/thinkfan. During the upgrade the state from the
    file is migrated automatically.

    Please refer to README.Debian how to manually manage the service.
